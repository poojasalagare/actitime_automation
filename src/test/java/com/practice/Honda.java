    //An interface contains only one extract method is called functional interface.
    //(it also contains static method and variable declaration also..)
    //i)We can implement that unimplemented methods by using implements keyword in a class..
    //ii)We can use anonymous class (we give reference of interface for accessing the implemented method in class->we can also use lambda expression )

    //Symbol of lambda expression : ->
    //It will

    //Note-While implemeting unimplemeted methods in interface always use public as access modifier
